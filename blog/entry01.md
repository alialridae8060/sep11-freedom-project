#### <ul>
#### <li>What tool did I decide on?; I decided to work the mild,one flaming emoji level tool Less.js.</li>
#### <li>Why did I choose Less.javascript ?; I choose Less.js to work with as I had a difficult time back in Sep 10 and I ended the year of with a 67% as my avergae in Sep 10 so I choose this tool as its an easy tool from what I saw on the list so I decided I would choose that tool.</li>
#### <li> How I tinkered with Less.javascript ?; whiel I haven't tinkered with it much I tinker swsith it in my IDE in a file in the tool folder of the sep11-freedom-project folder of my projects folder in my entire IDE that for this year is named javascript or js.
#### </ul>
