## Tool:Less.js

## Project:Buisness Decision Game.

### So I've decided to use Less.js due to its simplicity and the fact it involves CSS which I find easier than phaser.js.

### So I already used two forms of code in tinkering.md which are practice code structures from https://lesscss.org/ but I'm not sure if the results are good or bad since I've just started tinkering with them the first one is functions and let me sight wording from the website:"Less provides a variety of functions which transform colors, manipulate strings and do maths. They are documented fully in the function reference.Using them is pretty straightforward.".The next up is Namespaces and Accessors and heres the description from the website:"Sometimes, you may want to group your mixins, for organizational purposes, or just to offer some encapsulation. You can do this pretty intuitively in Less.".This is what I have so far.
