### So I've decided to use Less.js due to its simplicity and the fact it involves CSS which I find easier than phaser.js.

### So I already used two forms of code in tinkering.md which are practice code structures from https://lesscss.org/ but I'm not sure if the results are good or bad since I've just started tinkering with them the first one is functions and let me sight wording from the website:"Less provides a variety of functions which transform colors, manipulate strings and do maths. They are documented fully in the function reference.Using them is pretty straightforward.".The next up is Namespaces and Accessors and heres the description from the website:"Sometimes, you may want to group your mixins, for organizational purposes, or just to offer some encapsulation. You can do this pretty intuitively in Less.".This is what I have so far.

### So I decided to lock in and began learning about Less.js.So Less.js is also knwon as Leaner Style Sheets which is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS. This is the official documentation for Less, the language and Less.js, the JavaScript tool that converts your Less styles to CSS styles.The Variables of Less.js are pretty self explanatory as they are like the code for CSS.Next up is Mixins which are a way of including ("mixing in") a bunch of properties from one rule-set into another rule-set.Next up is Nesting where less gives you the ability to use nesting instead of, or combine with CSS.You can also bundle pseudo-selectors with your mixins using this method.
